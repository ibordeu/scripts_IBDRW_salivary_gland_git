# Inflationary theory of branching morphogenesis in the mouse salivary gland. 
## I Bordeu, L Chatzeli and BD Simons. (2023)

### Content description:

script_stochastic_IBDRW_model: Stochastic simulation of the three-dimensional (3d) inflationary branching-arresting random walk (IBDRW) model, for uniform and isotropic tissue
expansion (exponential or linear). This script uses the data in the "E14.5_trees" directory to load the initial condition of E14.5 netwroks. 
Place this folder in the same directory as the script before running the script. 

script_MFT_IBDRW_comoving_frame: Numerical integration of the rescaled 2d mean-field theory of the inflationary branching-delayed random walk (IBDRW) model.
 
### To run the scripts:
Open in Matlab and pres RUN. [tested in desktop and online version 2022a]
