## I Bordeu, L Chatzeli and BD Simons. (2022)

### Content description:

script_stochastic_IBARW_model: Stochastic simulation of the three-dimensional (3d) inflationary branching-arresting random walk (IBARW) model, for uniform and isotropic tissue
expansion. This script uses the data in the "E14.5_trees" directory to load the initial condition of E14.5 netwroks. 
Place this folder in the same directory as the script before running the script. 

script_MFT_IBARW_comoving_frame: Numerical integration of the rescaled 2d mean-field theory of the inflationary branch-ing-arresting random walk (IBARW) model.
 
### To run the scripts:
Open in Matlab and pres RUN. [tested in desktop and online version 2022a]
